                <li>In the remaining oil, sauté the rest of the onions and ginger-garlic paste until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Cook until vegetables are fork-tender but not mushy. The gravy should be thick, not watery.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Layering (Dum Process):-</li>
            <p>In a heavy pot, spread half the vegetable gravy.Top with half the par-cooked rice.Sprinkle fried onions, mint, and coriander.Repeat the layers, finishing with rice on top. Drizzle saffron milk and a spoonful of ghee.</p>

If using a thin-bottomed pan, place it on a preheated tawa (griddle) to prevent burning.Let the biryani rest for 10 minutes before opening. Fluff gently with a fork and serve with Raita or Salat.</p>
