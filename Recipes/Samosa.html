    <p>  Making a classic Punjabi samosa involves creating a firm, flaky pastry dough (crust) and a savory spiced potato and pea filling. For the best results in 2026, many chefs recommend a "double-fry" technique to achieve a non-greasy, ultra-crisp exterior.

    <ul><strong><u>Ingredients</u></strong>
        
        <li>Meda: 1-2 Cup</li>
        <li>oil: 1-2 tbsp</li>
        <li>Ajwain</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Potato</li>
        <li>Spices</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Steps:-</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Make the Dough:-</li>
            <p> Mix flour, carom seeds, and salt. Rub in the ghee with your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs and holds its shape when pressed. Add water gradually to form a very stiff, firm dough. Cover with a moist cloth and rest for 30–40 minutes.</p>
        <li>Prepare the Filling:-</li>
            <p>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a pan. Sauté cumin seeds, ginger, and green chilies. Add peas and spices, followed by crumbled potatoes. Sauté for 2–3 minutes. Stir in fresh coriander and allow it to cool completely before filling to avoid soggy pastry.</p>
        <li>Shape and Assemble:-</li>
            <p>Divide the dough into 6 equal balls and roll each into a thin oval (about 1mm thick).Cut the oval in half to create two semi-circles.Apply water to the straight edge, fold to form a cone, and seal the seam firmly.Fill with 2 tbsp of the potato mixture. Apply water to the open edges, make a small pleat on one side (to help it stand upright), and pinch to seal.</p>
        <Li>Fry:-</Li>
            <ul>
                <li>First Fry: Heat oil to about 160°C (320°F). Fry samosas for 3 minutes until the pastry is cooked but still pale. Drain on paper towels.</li>
                <li>Second Fry: Increase heat to 190°C (375°F). Fry in batches for 1.5–2 minutes until deep golden brown and crispy.</li>
            </ul>
    </ol>
